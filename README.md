# CS-300
This is a repository for my CS300 projects

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The problem that I was solving was what data structure should I use to help a University advisor store and print course information. The options I was given were a vector, hash table, and binary search tree. I had to analyze each one and make a recommendation on which I thought would be the best for their usage.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I tried to approach the problem practically in that I used logic to help me determine how the program would be used and guess on what requirements the advisors may have. These data structures are important to understand because each one has strengths and weaknesses that make them more or less effective for certain jobs.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I encountered a lot of roadblocks with getting the code to work the way I wanted to. There was numerous times where I wrote a bit of code and could not for the life of me figure out why they were giving errors or not giving the correct output. I used trial and error as well as plenty of research to help me get through the activities and the project. I think the result is that I was able to write a smart code that does exactly what the advisors want in an efficient manner.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
My work on this project certainly has broadened my understanding of data structures and how they can be used in coding. I now feel confident that I can plan to include a vector, hash table, or binary search tree in my projects and have a smarter and more efficient program for it.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
During the final project, I used a lot of what I learned in this class to write the code, make notes, and keep it adaptable. I would say that it changed the way I think about a code's design and how I go about make it. Now when I code, I feel more confident that I can write code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
